    "## Project Aims\n",
    "This project is a development of two previous projects that simulate motor races. The aim generally is to allow a team to make decisions that will optimize their race result. In the previous projects the question of interest was which is the optimum lap to take a mandatory pitstop. This project models the performance of the car in more detail so that it simulates the movement of a car around a racetrack allowing for the layout of the track, hence the car will brake approaching corners and accelerate out of them. As a result this allows more questions to be investigated.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to investigating the optimum lap for a pitstop, possible questions are:\n",
    "1. Should the car be set up to maximize top speed or maximize cornering speed for a particular track?\n",
    "2. How should the car be developed to maximize performance on the upcoming tracks?\n",
    "3. What is the best balance between preserving the tyres and driving aggressively?"

    "## Model Features\n",
    "\n",
    "The inclusion of track layout in this model introduces a number of new features and adds complexity to other features that were present in the earlier iterations.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Accelerating / Braking:\n",
    "A method is required to determine whether the car should accelerate or brake at any time depending on where it is on track.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Tracks and Corners:\n",
    "Track and corner class objects are used to store the track parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Overtaking:\n",
    "Speed advantage required to overtake / run side-by-side. Advantage required determined by track location (straight/corner).\n",
    "\n",
    "For straight, corner.overtake = 0 (ie any speed advantage will allow the car to overtake)\n",
    "For an open corner, corner.overtake = 2 (ie an advantage of 2m/s will allow car to overtake)\n",
    "For a tight corner, corner.overtake = 5\n",
    "For a very tight corner, corner.overtake = 10 (ie a car will only be able to overtake a much slower car)"
